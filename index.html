        <p>
            My name is Michael Mayo, II but you can just call me Mike. I am currently employed in the
            automotive industry as a technician but have set a goal to change careers by the end of the year.
            I plan to do that by completing the University of Arizona's coding bootcamp and become a developer.
            I am very excited to take on this journey I have set myself on and cannot wait to see what the end
            of it holds for me!
        </p>

        <p>
            I'll start with a little history on myself and how I came to this point.  I began my adult life 
            serving five years in the US Air Force as an Avionics System Technian on F-16 aircraft.  I enjoyed 
            the time I spent in the Air Force but never intended on it being a full career.  After separating from
            the Air Force I went to school at Unviersal Technical Institute and earned an Associate's degree in 
            Automotive Technology.  From there I went on to earn six ASE certifications as well as become an inspector 
            for Virginia's annual state safety inspections which are required for all vehicles registered in Virginia
            to pass.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since making the transition from the Air Force to the civilian world and working on cars I haven't been challenged 
            in ways I need to be.  Day to day work has become very simple and repetitive and I need a career that will 
            allow me to stimulate my mind and enjoy what I do.  I have since found out about coding and the development world 
            and have been extremely intrigued by it!  With the way technology changes and evolves so quickly I believe I will 
            always have the challenge I need to always enjoy work.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the accomplishments, professional or personal, I am most proud of is hiking the Southern California 
            section of the Pacific Crest Trail.  If you've never heard of this trail it runs from the California/Mexico border 
            winds through California, Oregon, and Washington and finishes eight miles into Canada.  The full trail is over 2,600 
            miles long!  I had intended on completing the length of the trail but was forced to come home due to injuries I could 
            no longer hike on.  I hiked through numerours injuries on the trail but ultimately I decided long-term health was more 
            important to me than finishing something I could always come back to.  With that said I plan to go back someday and 
            finish what I started!
        </p>

        <p>
            With this new career in sight I believe I will have greater oppurtunity to do the things I love outside of work and also 
            make a career which I love.  I foresee more flexibility and more oppurtunity for growth than what I have in my current 
            occupation.  I am determined to make the most of the new career and will not be looking back!
